### 🤔 What is this?
Language Learning Models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, not just enabling developers to build apps but also helping democratize data analysis. Leveraging LLMs to run analysis on public and private data for business is work for many reasons: quality of data, lack of standards, access control and compliance are just a few.

This repository leverages Open Data to provide example use cases 

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. 

Common examples of these applications include:

### ❓ Question/Answering on Open Census Data
Dataset: Census 2021 
End-to-end Example:(Open.DataGovs.com)

### 💁 Contributing

As an Open Data project, we showcase numerous public datasets that can be brought in to run your own examples. 

- Data Standards - Help us add new standards for reporting quality and compliant data for various industry use cases. 
- Data Visualization - Provide feedback on new methods of visualization of data for end-users leveraging the Open version of DataGovs.
- Data Sources - Public data is great, but some users might want to run private data that they own and can leverage for internal use cases. Contributors support public data.

### 💰 Commercialization

We’re a small, self-funded, fully-distributed team in the U.S. and we do not solicit users leveraging the public data tooling. We use OSS for those tools.
